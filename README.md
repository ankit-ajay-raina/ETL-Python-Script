# ETL-Python-Script
Created a Python script that performs ETL on the Yellow Taxi Data  and calculates n-day rolling average trip time.


IMPORTANT:
1. Files kept in the 'Data' folder are used to perform the ETL.

2. I have deliberately removed the files as the data is in Gigabytes.
In case, you want to test it yourself, please get the files from
